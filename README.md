# Container
Note that the code is based on two books:
- "Data Strcutrue For Game Programmers"
- "Data Abstraction & Problem Solving in C++" (6th edition)

I would also list some open-sourced code (e.g. DOOM 3 source code) as inspiration,
but there is no way for me to understand them (esp DOOM 3 containers with memory
allocators) fully at this stage.
